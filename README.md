# Comp320-artifact -  David Brown
## Project Description
This is a project to accompany my research dissertation for my final year university project. The artifact is a demo with 3 slightly differing versions of the same scene. Players are tested to see whether they can notice any differences between the three scenes regarding the movement of the character. Coyote Jump and Jump Buffer are both enabled in each of the versions that the participant will play through. The minor difference is that more time allowance is given the to the player in certain scenes whilst they will have less in others. The main goal of my research is to provide developers with a benchmark figure for each of the features with qualitative data to back up the numbers. For example, I may provide the guidance that 0.3 seconds of coyote jump benefitted the player most and brought the character movement more in line with their assumptions of how the player should move.

## Project State
According to my current thinking about the project, this is likely going to be the final version and will have already been distributed to all of the participants. It has no bugs to my knowledge and should be fairly easy to navigate for most participants.

## Changes I would have made
If I was to create this artifact again I would ensure that the level design is exactly the same each time as it may cause the participants to lose focus on the actual movement whilst they are focusing on the chnages in level.
